# Untitled Food App
## By [Sophie Chapman](https://twitter.com/sophiecantype)

After a particularly tricky family gathering that involved several food preferences, intolerances and allergies, I was inspired to create something that makes life a little bit easier for the people doing the cooking.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is in its early stages, so the diet/preferences options and ingredients list is limited. Also, I am not a dietician or nutritionist so don't rely on this app to decide what to feed your friends with allergies and whatnot.
